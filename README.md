# medion-sources-list
Tools to work on the sources list of Medion TV sets

[clean_service_list](./clean_service_list) cleans the list from a number of channels we don't need as the TV doesn't support mass deletion. It removes all locked channels except the Austrian ones (ORF) and a number of other channels. A number of German channels (NDR, WDR, etc.) are reduced to one entry. See the script for details.
